# Simple NES C Project

## About

This repository is a simple C workspace to make NES programs/projects.

I simplified [nesdoug](https://github.com/nesdoug)'s workspace, so thanks to him.

## Compile and Run

Before compiling you need to **install [CC65](https://cc65.github.io/)** and make. And **change the compiler and emulator location in the Makefile**

Then to compile you need to just run:

```bash
make
```

To run you just write:

```bash
make run
```

That's it! A simple `"Hello, world!"` program is in the workspace by default.
